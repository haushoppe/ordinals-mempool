# v0.0.2 â€“ "Inscription Accelerator" ðŸš€ 

**New Feature:**

We are proud to present the 'Inscription Accelerator'! ðŸš€  ([PR #6](https://github.com/haushoppe/ordpool/pull/6))

Is your inscription stuck in the mempool and you don't want to wait any longer?
We can help you to create a high-priority follow-up transaction that will boost this inscription.
Made in partnership with our friends at OrdinalsBot.

- Fixes broken caching of existing blocks, see [#1](https://github.com/haushoppe/ordpool/issues/1)

**Known Issues:**

- Right now, the Parser is not aware of batch inscriptions, see [#2](https://github.com/haushoppe/ordpool/issues/2)
