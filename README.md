This is a fork of the awesome [The Mempool Open Source Project](https://github.com/mempool/mempool#the-mempool-open-source-project) â€“ with changes for the Bitcoin Ordinals community.

So you know in advance what will be inscribed next.

We've extracted the Inscription parser to a separate repository! 
Now it's your turn! Fork it and add support for Bitcoin Stamps, Atomicals or any other Metaprotocol.
Can't wait to see what you come up with! ðŸš€

Mempool is the fully-featured mempool visualizer, explorer, and API service running at [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/). 

It is an open-source project developed and operated for the benefit of the Bitcoin community, with a focus on the emerging transaction fee market that is evolving Bitcoin into a multi-layer ecosystem.

# Installation Methods

Mempool can be self-hosted on a wide variety of your own hardware, ranging from a simple one-click installation on a Raspberry Pi full-node distro all the way to a robust production instance on a powerful FreeBSD server. 

**Most people should use a one-click install method.** Other install methods are meant for developers and others with experience managing servers.

## One-Click Installation

Mempool can be conveniently installed on the following full-node distros: 
- [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel)
- [RaspiBlitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz)
- [RoninDojo](https://code.samourai.io/ronindojo/RoninDojo)
- [myNode](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode)
- [Start9](https://github.com/Start9Labs/embassy-os)

**We highly recommend you deploy your own Mempool instance this way.** No matter which option you pick, you'll be able to get your own fully-sovereign instance of Mempool up quickly without needing to fiddle with any settings.

## Advanced Installation Methods

Mempool can be installed in other ways too, but we only recommend doing so if you're a developer, have experience managing servers, or otherwise know what you're doing.

- See the [`docker/`](./docker/) directory for instructions on deploying Mempool with Docker.
- See the [`backend/`](./backend/) and [`frontend/`](./frontend/) directories for manual install instructions oriented for developers.
- See the [`production/`](./production/) directory for guidance on setting up a more serious Mempool instance designed for high performance at scale.
