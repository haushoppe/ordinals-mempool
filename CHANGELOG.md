Announcement: https://twitter.com/HausHoppe/status/1781222510303785339

**What a wild ride. We unleached the cats!! Thank you everyone for being part of the creation of a new protocol on Bitcoin.** We started a movement! 

CAT-21 is a novel protocol that utilizes Bitcoin transactions and the Ordinals Theory to mint unique digital collectibles â€“ CAT-21 ordinals. Each CAT-21 ordinal is linked to a unique pixelated cat image with various traits, offering a fresh and playful perspective on Bitcoin transactions and the Ordinals theory. Why? Because it's fun and complely free! And free means free! The minting process is completely free. **Price: FREE, no strings attached.** ðŸ˜º


Read more about the **CAT-21 protocol** [in the whitepaper](https://github.com/ordpool-space/cat-21)<!--and [on the official website](https://cat21.space/)-->.

**More Features:**

* Basic support for delegate inscriptions â†’ [Example](https://ordpool.space/tx/6b6f65ba4bc2cbb8cec1e1ca5e1d426e442a05729cdbac6009cca185f7d95bab)
* Various small improvements for the Inscription Accelerator

'Experimental' means that SRC-20 Bitcoin Transactions are highlighted in the Mempool Block Overview and shown on the Transaction-Details page, but they are not highlighted for confirmed blocks.
